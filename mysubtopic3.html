    <h1>What are Gamemodes?</h1>
      <p>Gamemodes are different ways to play the game by chosing what kind of game you want to play. There are many different kinds that range from the competitive people to the casual people</p>

                <td id="games">Quick play is a quick and easy way to hop into a game. Once you hop in, you canp start playing and testing strategies, team compositions,
                  and new heroes you want to learn. It is casual so there is not cost to play it and there is not penalty for losing. Once the game is over,
                  you will gain xp depending on if you win or lose. You will also gain xp depending on your performance in the match.</td>

                <td id="games">Arcade</td>
                <td id="games">Arcade has a few modes in it. Arcade is a collection of smaller games that don't fit in another category. These include FFA which is where 8 players
                  fight to see who can get to 20 eliminations fastest. Another gamemode is Low Gravity which is exactly what is sounds like. Another gamemode is Total
                  Mayhem where cooldowns are turned down a lot, everyone has more health, and ultimates charge faster. There is also No limits where you can have duplicates of characters
                  on a team. The last popular mode is Mystery Heroes where you are given a random hero at the start of the match and everytime you die you are given another
                  random hero. A mode that was taken out of the game was All Brawl which is similar to the genre of arcade. There would be specific gamemodes with specific rules.
                  For example, super shimada brothers where you can only pick genji or hanzo. Another was snipers only where you can only play Widowmaker, Hanzo, or Ana. A very popular
                  one was where each team had 1 Lucio and everyone else was Reinhardt.</td>

                <td id="games">Competitive</td>
                <td id="games">This is similar to Quick Play but instead of being casual, winning raises your rank and losing lowers it. The game is two sided where each team gets a chance to
                  attack and defend and the game lasts a lot longer. You get points by playing competitive which you can spend to unlock golden guns for your heroes. At the end of the
                  season you get a player icon and a spray depending on where you were on the leaderboard.</td>

                <td id="games">Community Browser</td>
                <td id="games">This gamemode is similar to arcade but the games are made by real people. There are games from roleplay to practicing your aim. The options for these games
                  are endless. You can have only Mercy on each team and you can one shot everyone by punching them once. Another mode can be where you always can use your ultimate
                  and you have no cooldowns and you play a regular game like this. The browser can also be used to host games with your friends where you can just have fun in a private
                  game.</td>

                  and is a great place for people new to the game to learn what each hero does.</td>
