    <h1>What are strategies and team compositions?</h1>
      <p>Strategies and team compositions are specified strategies that are made up of specific hero combinations. A good team composition can work poorly while
        a bad tea composition can work well as long as it has a strategy. A strategy that is good will override a good team composition almost every time.</p>

            <td>The strategy is just like the name entails. The Reinhardt leads the team, usually with a charge, and the Mercy or Ana backs him up while the
              high damage output of the Damage heroes and the Roadhog put together focus fire each enemy. The lucio helps speed boost everyoen so the deathball moces quickly.</td>

            <td>The strategy is similar in the way that Deathball works. The team will use its high mobility to swoop in and quickly take out each target one by one. This composition is
            usually used for capture the point maps and needs a good amount of coordination to pull off.</td>

                </ol></td>
            <td>This strategy is specificaly made for payload maps. The Orisa or Reinhardt will set up on the payload with their shield. It is usually Orisa
              because she can shoot while her shield is up. The Bastion will join them on the cart behind the shield and spray damage at the enemy. The Roadhog
              will act as a bodyguard to the bastion and the far range Damage heroes will pick off the enemy before they reach the payload. The healer needs to be able to
              move their healing between the payload and the Damage heroes with ease.</td>

            <td>Even though this team composition is lacking damage, it should not be underestimated as this strategy was able to carry a professional team
              through an entire tournament, winning them the season. It is similar to Deathball where Reinhardt charges and Zarya bubbles him while Lucio uses
              speed boost but D. Va is there to take care of the high ground while everyone else tries to keep the fight in close quarters combat.</td>

            <td>This is the most common strategy in the game. It is very simple and can easily fluctuate to whatever each team member can play. A lot of the
              time a Tank or Support will be swapped for another Damage Hero depending on the situation.</td>
