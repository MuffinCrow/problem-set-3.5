    <h1>What are Heroes?</h1>
      <p>Heroes are playable characters with Overwatch that are also from lore.
         These characters can range from a cyborg ninja to a hamster on a wrecking ball.
         This wide variety of heroes can make the selection of what hero to play a difficult feat in their first match.
         The table below will briefly explain each character categorized by the class they are in.</p>
