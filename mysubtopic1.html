    <h1>What are Heroes?</h1>
      <p>Heroes are playable characters with Overwatch that are also from lore.
         These characters can range from a cyborg ninja to a hamster on a wrecking ball.
         This wide variety of heroes can make the selection of what hero to play a difficult feat in their first match.
         The table below will briefly explain each character categorized by the class they are in.</p>

              with ease. When the mech runs out of health, she pops out of the mech and can shoot her pistol to build up ult charge.
              Once she activates her ult out of her mech, she can resummon the mech at full health to continue fighting.</td>
